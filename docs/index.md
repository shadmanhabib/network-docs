# Welcome to the Home Lab

This site serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for the network architecture employed in the home lab. It is designed to provide an overview of the various systems and configurations, acting as a reference for existing setups and future planning. This wiki is intended for internal use but may be a valueable resource for general readers.

The home lab is organised in a wall mounted network rack in the garage and is equipped with multiple Raspberry Pi devices. Each device is dedicated to specific functions such as home automation, network management, media streaming, and backup solutions. Additionally, an Ubuntu server powers essential applications like Jellyfin, Frigate, Paperless-ngx, and Syncthing.

## Key Features

- **Network Architecture Overview:** Detailed breakdowns of the network setup and configurations for each Raspberry Pi.
- **Reference Material:** Comprehensive guides on setting up and managing services like Home Assistant, Pi-hole, and more.
- **Best Practices:** Recommendations for maintaining a secure and efficient home network.
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step instructions for integrating various home automation devices.
